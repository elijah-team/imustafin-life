## Getting it Working

Needs a working GUI toolkit and compiler.

* Compiler: [Elijah Compiler](https://gitlab.com/elijah-team/elijah-lang)
* GUI Toolkit: 
  * While I don't intend on reimplementing Eiffel Vision, I would ask that any contributors just implement the classes, even if minimally, instead of replacing them.
  * I have no idea which GUI kit will be the first to be implemented in **Elijah**
* Needs an `.ez` file

## Playground

Actually, this would be perfect for a playground, especially with the fixed size window and the simplicity of the app.
